				<p>&nbsp;REOL (stylized as RÎžOL) is a Japanese musical unit that consists of vocalist/lyricist Reol,
				music arranger GigaP, and movie director/producer Okiku. The members from REOL originally worked 
				as solo artists, but they signed to Toy's Factory as a group in 2015, using Reol's name for the project.
				Prior to its formation, both Reol and GigaP consistently worked together, eventually releasing an album together
				titled No Title, while Reol worked as a solo artist. However, all three members released their debut studio album,
				Sigma, on October 19, 2016.</p>
